            <h1>The Day My Mother Forgot to Cry</h1>
            <p>
                It was the dreadful Diwali night of October 2007, one that still sends shivers down my spine. My mother knocked on our bedroom door in the dead of the night, disoriented and confused. She asked where the toilet was, which left us puzzled. We assumed she was sleepwalking, guided her to the toilet, and helped her return to bed. But her confusion persisted—she couldn’t find her way back to her bedroom.

                Realizing something was seriously wrong, we rushed her to a nearby nursing home the next morning. After an MRI scan, the neurosurgeon confirmed our fears: she had suffered a brain stroke. The scan revealed grey patches—clots—that had severely impacted her memory. The doctor explained that her memory loss was irreversible due to her age but assured us that further damage could be managed with medications.

                For us, she became the center of our world, almost like a child in need of constant care and affection. We celebrated her 80th birthday with a grand cake-cutting ceremony, surrounded by friends and family. Though she couldn’t comprehend the significance of the occasion, her smile lit up the room. When someone wished her a happy birthday, she cheerfully reciprocated, blissfully unaware of whose birthday it was.

                Despite her illness erasing most of her memories, certain habits and courtesies remained deeply ingrained. As a former telephone operator, she never forgot to say “thank you” for even the smallest acts of kindness. It was touching to see that, while her disease took away her memories, it couldn’t take away her grace.

                One night, we were jolted awake by the sound of her body hitting the floor. My wife rushed to find her lying face down, motionless. Her forehead was injured, and blood trickled from her lips. We carefully lifted her back to the bed, cleaned her wounds, and asked if she was in pain. She affirmed, but her face was blank—devoid of expression or emotion. The disease had robbed her of her ability to feel and even cry. I cried silently as I looked at her fragile state.

                The day she passed away, as her body was carried in a hearse van, unexpected showers poured for a few moments—as if the heavens themselves cried on her behalf, because she had forgotten how to.
